text, but differ in respect of the stopping,
some pntting a stop after ‘torpor‚'
others after ‘ procerum! The nomina·
tive by itsell is harsh ; some such words
as ‘ propriae sunt ' having to besupplied
with ‘sordes’; and although it seems
clear that ‘omnium' is opposed to
‘procerum' it is not so certain whether
the ‘sordes' and ‘torpor’ are meant to
be points oi resemblance to Germans
· (cp. c. ao‚1; 15, 1) or of differeuce (c.
aa, 13 14, 3). The latter view is most
in accordance with the context here as
a whole ; the whole passage ‘sordes . . .
traxerant’ being apparently a descrip-
tion ol non-German traits‚ and German
‘proceres’ at least being generally
described as energetic (c. 13, 14). Some
follow Urlichs in inserting the words
‘sordes . . procerum’ between ⁴ dubito'
and ‘quamquam’ making ‘omnium'
refer to all the three nations here men-
tioned.

a. habitum, ‘appearance': cp. c.
4, 2.

trast to the mere ‘habitus’ as also
‘multum’ to ‘nonnihiL’

tignorum. ‘have derived': cp. A.
15. 8, 4.

erigitur, ‘lists itself’: cp. ‘insula
. . . erigitur' (Verg. Aen. 8, 416).

peramant, perhaps more emphatic
than ‘latrociniis'; ior Germans also
had plundering habits (c. 14, 5), though
less pronounced than those of less
settled tribes.

tamen. ‘in spite oi these differences!

5. domos figunt, ‘they construet
permanent houses': cp. (Frisii) ‘fixerant
domos' (A. 13. 54, 3).

6. pedum, taken also with ‘pemici·
tate' The Sarmatae relied only ou the
‘pernicitas equorum‚’ and were most in·
efficient on loct, most formidable on
horseback (H. 1. 793 4).

7. sarmatis, brachylogical lor ‘ Sar-
matarum moribus)

Pennis mira feritas. The three
nations are described in a descending
series; the Bastarnae differed somewhat
from the German type, the Venedi
more, the F enni most of all.

8. non arma T he bows and arrows
mentioned below are used to procare
lood and are not counted as arms.

non penates, ‘no household' (cp.
c. 15, 1), no regular dwelling place, in
coutrast to ‘domos figunt' above.
