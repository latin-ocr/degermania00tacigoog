98 CORNELII TACIYI DE GERMANIA

Druso Germanico sed obstitit Oceanus in se simul atque
in Herculem inquiri. mox nemo temptavit, sanctiusque ac
reverentius visum de actis deorum credere quam scire.

assign to his glory.' passes to a less known region.
· comunimus, not necessarily ‘nos 6. tacenti flexu, the ‘sinus' of c.
Romani,' but general belief, asimplied 37, 1, and c. 1, 1. He appears to
in ‘fama vulgavit' mean the great recess of Jutland‚ which

a. Druso Gemanica Thebrother
of Tiberius is so spoken ofin H. 5.
19, 2. The sumame was not given till
after his death, and was borne by his
posterity. Suet. (Cl. 1) calls him the
first Roman who sailed the North Sea,
and the same langnage is used of his
expedition or that ofTiberins in ‘Monu-
mentum Ancyrannm,' v. 14 (see on c. 1,
1): ‘elassis mea per Oceanum ab ostio
Rheni ad solis orientis regiones usque
ad fines Cimbrorum navigavit, quo
neque terra neque mari qnisquam Ro·
manus ante id tempus adit? lt is some-
what strange that no other explorer is
here noticed, hence the suggested read-
ings ‘Druso Germanico, ‘Druso et
Germanico,' ‘Druso, Neroni, Germa-
nico’ (ep. 0· 37, 5)·

37, 4. The Ocean is personified‚ as
above in ‘temptavimus' δια, and con·
ceived to resent the inquiry asan in·
trusion.

3. mox, ‘afterwards': cp. c. 2, 5.

sanctiusque ao reverentius, ‘more

Perhaps he speaks ironically, as he
seems to regnet the wantos enterprise
(c. 1, a).

and ‘magnificum'

he perhaps took to be a general exten-
sion of the coast, rather than a penin-
sula, and to begin further westward.

recedit. This reading is confirmed
by the appearance of a reminiscente of
a sentence in Mela 3.1, 8 (⁴in illam
partem quae recessit ingens flexus ape·
ritur'). On the other hand me MS.
text ‘redit' is supported by the ‘redit
...Rhodope‘of Verg. G. 3. 351.

chaucorum. This people lived
alonfi the coast from the Ems perhaps
to te Elbe, and were divided into
‘ maiorea’ and ‘minores’ (A. 11. 19, 3),
parted by the Weser. Their territory
would thus answer to part of Hano·
ver. Oldenburg, and Bremen. ln part
at least they were subject to Rome
under Tiberius (A. 1.38‚1; 60,3; a.
17, 7), but afterwards revolted or were
let gn, probably from AD. 17. Cor·
bulo was prevented from attacking
them in an. 47 (A. 11. 19, 6), and they
are found in arms with Civilis (H. 4.
79, 33 5. 19, 1). The account given of
them by Tacitus is far more applieahle
to them asa whole than that of Pliny,
whose general description of them (16.
1, 1) as living on hillocks or platforms '
surrounded at high tide, and aining
a miserable subsistence by hshing,
could only be true of those on the ex·
treme coast. The name is thought to
be from a word signifying ‘the high,‘
probably in reference to stature (cp.
Vell. 2. 106, r, cited below), or perhaps
to superiority (ep. 5 4).

7. quamquam maturat: cp.c.28,5.
