THE ACCOUNT GIVEN ΒΥ TACITUS 31

The picture is not indeed wholly without its other side, when the h
candour os the historian asserts itsell against the desire to idealize.
It is admitted that their independence is even excessivo ¹, that they
are torn to pieces by internal feuds², impulsive and unsteady in
battle ³, indolent and quarrelsome in peace ⁴, predatoryt, drunkenss,
absorbed by the passion for gambling⁷; in lact that their finer
qualities are by no means without the vices which in a low state of
civilization are apt to go with them.

In attempting to gather the description of the country and its ,
people into generalizations, we are often baffled by difficulties probably
due to unexplained diversity. The discrepancies between Caesar and
Tacitus, or those between Tacitus and himself, or between either of
them and the earliest later knowledge, may often arise from the
different stages of civilization of different tribes, and srotn the attempt
to disguise variations u'nder a condensed general statement. Some-
times distinctions are drawn, but they rn'ay have been oltener omitted
where they exist. We are told, for instance, that royalty had its
grades from the most despotic to the most limited⁸; it was perhaps '
no less true that there were free states with and without permanent
chiel magistrates ⁹. Wandering life, sustained by floclrs and herds,
would hardly have given way everywhere to settled dwellings and
agriculture in the 150 years between Caesar and Tacitus if it had
not been already partial and on the wane at the time ol the sormer¹⁰ ;
hunting, though it may have declined, could hardly at the earlier
date have been a general pursuit, except among a certain class and
in favourable districts ¹¹ ; in religion, Caesar may. have given us the
lowest and most popular, Tacitus the more advanced conception ol
divinity¹². ’

It is perhaps for the same reason that our descriptions often give
us traces of an institution conrplieated or crossed by something
different ¹⁸. Patriarchal government has still its survivals ¹⁴, and the
family tie is still of extreme importante 15; even the more primitive
