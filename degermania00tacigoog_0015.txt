viii PREFACE

Kemble's Anglo-Saxons in England (Lond0n‚ 1876)
and from Bishop Stubbs' Constitutional History of
England vol. i, also from Prof. Freeman’s History
of the Norman Conquest, vol. i, and Growth of the
English Constitution (London, 1872), ΜΓ. F. See-
bohm's The English Village Community (london,
1884) and other works specified in places, lt is
greatly to be wished that English students should
follow the example set by these writers, especially by
Bishop Stubbs, in recognizing the importance of this
treatise among the original authorities for their own
national history.

Several monographs and other works have been
consulted and, Ι believe, duly acknowledged; it will
be seen that many other such are cited at second
hand only; and I fear Ι must apologize for the
omission of many more which have been overlooked
or are altogether unknown to me.

Ι have here to express my regret that Ι had
omitted, until after the following pages were printed,
to consult the essay of M. de Coulanges (Recherches
sur quelques problemes d'llistoire. Paris. 1885) on the
German land tenure and the statements of Caesar and
Tacitus respecting it. lt has been satisfactory to find
that on many important points his conclusions are
in accordance with those which Ι have endeavoured to
set forth; but Ι should have been very glad to have
reconsidered in detail several notes on ch. 26 and on
other passages in the light of his arguments.
