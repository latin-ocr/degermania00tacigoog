so-called matriarclutl system is not untraceable ¹, but the state of
society as awhole has far outgrown them. The mixed idea given
usos the hostin battle, with its picked national troops, its ‘cuneus'
of free families, its groups of ‘comites' attendant on the ‘principes ’ξ
suggests again a possibility that one form of this organization may
have been prominent with some and another with others ⁸. Most
of all may this be true os their village life andland system. The
possessiones lands by village commynities in some form is far too
widespread and manifold to be a characteristic of any people ⁴, and
often seems to adapt itself to some preexistent institutions, orto
survive in some ways or reassert itself where lt has been more or l&
departed from, or otherwise to take different forms. It is at least
clear in Germany that we have the village as a subdivision of the
‘pagus' and that it regulated in some way the occupatiori of the land
compriscd in it ⁶. The chief description that we have might in most
points approach to a description of a free village under the ‘llfarlt’
system ⁶. Yet it would be bold to say that permanent individual
possession of land finds no place in the statement l, or that there
might not have been cases ln which the whole village was a cluster
of dependente ona common lord⁸, or that other intermediate forms
0f tenure may not have been in existence. Great movements, such
as those which launched the Teutonic tribes against the decaying
Roman empire, would lead naturally to great changes in these
matters ⁹, and it is more remarkable that so much of the account
given in this treatise should be recognizable than that so much should
have passed away.
