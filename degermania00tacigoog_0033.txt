Homeric age ². Like these, they constantly bear arms in daily life³,
they show hospitality to the stranger no less than to 1111111114, they
reckon value in oxen or other animals ⁶, they get their wives by a kind
of purchase⁶, blood vengeanee and its atonement by a romi are
recognized institutions ⁷, the kings are honoured by quasi-voluntary
gilts ⁸, the submission 01 great questions, such as war and peace, to
a general assembly 011111 people, 11111 previous discussion by the
chiels⁹‚ reminds us 01 the Homeric βουλή and ἀγορή ¹⁰, and the
„tumultuous spear-clashing by which approval was indicated ¹¹, is but
-a variation from the Achaean shout ¹².

On the other hand we notice no less striking and instructive
differenees. ln some respects‚ especially as regards the arts and
appliances 01 1111, the Germans are at a far lower stage, as we should

scarce with Germans, the iton-tipped ‘framea' is the only universal
weapon, the shield is 01 mere painted boards, the sword and massy
spear and corslet are rare, the helmet in any form almost unknown ¹³,

t.he Homeric ship must have been some stages removed from the
