quibus, &c.‚ ‘who make profession
of that exhibition' (cp. A. 1. 52, 4, &c.).
It seems not to have been practised
by all, and was probably confined to
freemen.

7. aleam, &c At Rome dicing was
forbidden by law (see Hor. od. 3. 24,
58), and, though no doubt common

revelry, or at such times as the Satur·

occupations.’

9. temeritate, ‘reeklessness’z we
should naturally expect ‘ludendi’ for

substituted.

extremo ao novissimo,‘ the deci-
sive and last throw.’ The ideas are
virtually the same; for similar instances,
see Introd. p. 10.

ιο, corpore, ‘ his person! A similar
custom is recorded of the Huns, and
55². alludes to a poem in the Rig·vedaa
and other tales evidencing a prevalence
of gambling among the ancient Indians.

11. iuvenior. This rare comparative
form is found in Columella, Pliny mi,
and Appuleius.
