ipsis in nullo usu: rude legitur, informe perfertur, pretiumque
6mirantes accipiunt. sucum tamen arborum esse intellegas
quia terrena quaedam atque etiam volucria animalia plerumque
interiacent, quae implicata humore mox durescente materia
veluduntur. fecundiora igitur nemora lucosque sicut Orientiss
secretis, ubi tura balsamaque sudantur, ita Occidentis insulis
terrisque inesse crediderim, quae vicini solis radiis expressa
atque liquentia in proximum mare labuntur ac vi tempes-
8 tatum in adversa litora exundant. si naturam sucini admoto
igni temptes, in modum taedae accenditur alitque flammam rc
pinguem et olentem ; mox ut in picem resinamve lentescit.

to get itin Nero’s time, and brought
home an enormous quantity. It is
earlier alluded to as an ornament in
Ov. M. 2. 366.

1. rude . . . informo, ‘rough and
shapeless?; so of stones in A. 12, 35, 5. '

a. tamen, ie. though the people ,
themselves knew nothing of it.

sucum...erborum: see on§5.

3. terrena . . .' volucria animalia,
‘creeping and winged creatures.' Pliny
(ξ 46) instances ants, gnats, and lizards,
Martial (6. 59) even a viper.

plerumque, ‘osten’; cp. c. 13,
4, &c

5. cluduntur = ‘includuntur’; on
the use of simple ior compouud words,

mont Orientis seeretis, ‘as in the
retired regions of the East.’

6. turubalaamuque. Frankincense
came only from the Arabian Sabaeans
(Verg. G. 2, 117), and balsam or balm
from Palestine (H. 5. 6, 5).

sndantur: ior the passive cp. ‘suda-
taque ligno tura’ (Ov. M. ιο, 388).
The alternative ‘sudant' is retained by
some, who take it transitively, as in
Verg. Ecl. 8, 55 (⁸ sudent electra
myricae ’), &c., and supply a subject
lrom ‘nemora lucosque.’

7. queo . . . expressa, &a This
is generally taken to be an extremely
harsh brachylogy ior ‘nemora lucosque

quorum suci expressi,' διας many have
supposed a corruption, aud various
emendations have been suggested. It
is perhaps a lesser difficulty to take the
words as they stand by supplying from
‘qnae’ a subject (‘ea') to ‘inesse’
‘As iu the East there are more pro·
ductive trees than elsewhere, so I would
believe that in the islands and mainland
oi the West there are substances which,'
&a That these substances also are
found in trees, would be implied rather
thanexpressed.

vicini solie: cp.§ 1.

9. exundant, ‘are cast up.’

naturam, ‘the substance,‘ qualities:
for ‘temptes’ cp. c. 6, 5 ; 14, 3.

11. utin picem, ‘into a substance
like pitch.'

lentescit, ‘dissolves’; so of that
which becomes sticky in Verg. G.
2, 250.

ιι. Suionibus, &e If these words
are rightly placed here, we must suppose
that he goes back to the Sitones as
