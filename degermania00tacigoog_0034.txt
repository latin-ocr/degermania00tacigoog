THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BV TACITUS 19

palace ol Menelaus ¹ would still have had no counterpart in its surniture
and adornment among the dwellings of even princely Germans ¹.

To set against these, there are points in which the Germans had
reached a considerably higher stage. The sense of liberty and
personal dignity, by no means prominent in the Homeric δῆμοςθ, is
here sully developed: the German comesto assemblies as and when
he pleases‚ is unmistakably free to disapprove as well as to approve‚
and has rather to be persuaded than coerced ⁴, and the king is hardly
more prominent in it than others whose position or achievements
entitle them to be heard.

On the German king we would gladly have heard more from
Tacitus ⁶. We gather that he was chosen‚ but only from the noblest
lineage ¹, the ‘stirps regia ⁷,rgenerally represented as ol divine descent,
in the full sense droy‘evr'ye. But, however approaching to a despotic
monarch in the most remote and backward tribes ⁸, he has elsewhere
more dignity than power. Itis even 'doubtful whether he is necessarily
the leader in war ⁹, and certainly the supreme coercive authority both
in the field and in the assembly belongs not to him but to the priest ¹⁰.
He has a faint survival ol primitive priestly function in augury ¹¹, hc
has a share of fines¹¹, and probably of other presents ¹³, but does not
appoint judges or magistrates ¹⁴, and generally reigns rather than
govems; while any such royalty as that ol Marobodum, embracing
many tribes, and almost confronting the Caesar as an equal, was
most abnormal and obnoxious to the sentiment ol independence ¹⁵.
Again‚ even such limited kingly rule, though prevalent among the
Suebic Germans¹⁰, is represented as generally dispensed with among
the western and more advanced tribes ¹⁷, and replaced by the rule ol
an elected magistrate ¹⁸, or probably in more cases by no other central
