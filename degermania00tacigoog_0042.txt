THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BV TACITUS 27

taken the place of the old patriciate, while the rank and file of the
‘clientela’ tended to absorb into itself the body of ¹ ceorls' or freemen.

On the great subject ol German religion and mythology little ean
here be said except by way of explanation and criticism of Tacitus, ·
who, though much in advanee of Caesar ¹, is yet meagre, and not easy
to reconcile with himself. German gods are known to him through
an ‘interpretatio Romana ¹,’ ready made to his hands, aud without
any grounds of identification stated to us, as Mercurius, Hercules,
Mars, Isis, Terra Mater, Mater deum, Castor and Pollux ³, nor are
we told clearly whether Hercules is god or hero, whether the great
goddess is one or three, on what ground the three gods named
together are selected for prominence, whether either of themis the
‘parent of the race,' the ‘ruler of all things ¹,' whether the same was
everywhere supreme.

Sufficient resemblance is found in Celtic⁶ and German mythology
to point to a common origin, and in the supreme god of both races
the Romans recognize a ‘Mercurius⁶.’ Among the Germans this
must clearly be Wuodan, a god really of most complex and ubiquitous
attributes, with analogies both to the Varuna'¹ and to the Indra⁸ of
the Vedas, and to other primitive conceptions of an elemental deity,
but no doubt more vividly present to Germans probably as the creator
of their racc, certainly as ancestor of their hings⁹, and as the 'god
and hero of their advancement¹⁰, both as a genius os war and father
of victories and wielder ol the magic spear¹¹, and also as the culture
god, the instructor in learning and arts, the traveller, the magician,
and thus their Hermes, and noless their Prometheus UlysseS, Orpheus,
Jason, probably (as shown below) their Heracles¹². His supremacy,
if of universal recognition, may not have been so from all time, but
