that prince, in no. 97, or immediately after his death in 98 ¹. He
was therefore either consul or a consular, and thus in the highest
senatorial rank, when he published this treatise, probably very shortly
after the publication of the Agricola.

PURPOSE OF THE TREATISE.

Much bas been written on this subject ², but the conclusions reached
can never be fully satisfactory, as the internal evidence, aided by what

go upon.

The appearance of this work almost simultaneously with one so
different from it as the Agricola suggests the existence ol some
motives common to both, and others peculiar to each treatise. As
regards the first kind, it must be borne in mind that Tacitus however
eminent as a pleader and orator, was probably as yet very little known

ultimately appeared as his ‘Historiae ⁴,' and might well have desired
to prepare the way by something on a less ambitious scale, and to

He would also have been encouraged to the composition of
