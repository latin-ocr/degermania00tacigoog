here read ‘Lygiorum'), and the Med.
MS. of Tacitus in A. 12. 29, 3, ⁴ ligii,'
which is perhaps intended by MSS.
here. The name hasbeen suggested
to mean ‘dwellers in woodland' (or
marshland)‚ but is quite uncertain.
Os the separate names given here little
or nothing is known. The Helveeones
should perhaps be ‘Helveeones' the
Αὶλουαίωνες of Ptol. (2. 11. 7) ‚ who joins
them with the Βούργουντες l‘Burgo-
diones’ ol Plin.), i. e. the Burgundians,
ol whom Tacitus knows nothipg, but
who, with the Vandals‚ appear to be
the later representatives of these Lugian
tribes. Some, however, as Latham,
consider the Lugians to be Slavs, and
ancestors oi the Poles.

3. antiquae religionis, ‘of an an·
cient worship’ ; ‘ religioni ' is supplied
with ‘praesidet’ The worship was
probably common to all these Lugian
tribes, and the deities were probably
conceived as ancestors oi the race (as
in c. 40, 2).

4. muliebri ornatu. Mi. considers
that this is to be understood oi the hair
only, and that the priest was one ol
the ‘Hazdinge’ (‘men with women's
hair ’), known later as the Vandal royal
race.

be that the gods are male.

able to a race of horsemen‚ such as
were the later Vandals.

6. Aleis. None of the pairs of hero
brothers mentioned above bear any
such name, and its form and meaning
are much disputed. It hasbeen gene·
rally taken as dat. (cp. ‘maioribus
minoribusque' c. 34,.1)‚ from a form
‘Aleae’ or ‘Alci' but the nominative
is certainly the usual case iu Tacitus sor
substantives in such expressions (see
Nipp. on A. a. 16, 1), which would
suggest such a form as ‘Alceis,' or
that ‘Alces’ or ‘Alei ’⁴ should be read.
Some would connect the word with ἀργός
(‘brigbt’), others with ἄλκη. Holz·
