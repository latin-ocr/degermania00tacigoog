subiecta atque parentia. adicit auctoritatem fortuna Semno-
num: centum pagi iis habitantur, magnoque corpore efficitur
ut se Sueborum caput credant.

40. Contra Langobardos paucitas nobilitat: plurimis ac
valentissimis nationibus cincti non per obsequium, sed proc-5
liis ac periclitando tuti sunt.

Mf. thinks that this idea specially con·

whose name he takes to mean ‘offspring'
(i. e. of the god).

regnatoromnr'um deus. From the
fact that the later Schwabians were
eutitled ‘ Ziuwari‘ (worshippers of Ziu
or Tiu) Grimm infers that the deity
here was not Wodan but Tiu; who
would thus appear in this very primi·
tire worship to have been conceived not
as the mere war god (see on c. 9, 1),
but (as the name itself suggests) as
a more general deity, answering to Zeus
or Dyans. This would make it pro·
bable that we have here the general
worship of the Herminones (c. a, 3);
that in c. 40. a being conjectured to
belong to the Ingaevones.

1. adicit auctoritatem, ‘gives them
further consideratiou'(amongtheSuebi);
ie. makes them ‘nobilissimi,' as their
religion shows theru to be ‘vetustissimi'
o u·

2. centnm pari iis habitantum so
Halm, Mn, SS‘A most others read
‘pagis habitant! It has been noted
that Caesar states this fact of the Suebi
as awhole (see on c. 38, 1). It has
been thought that we have here, as else-
where (c 6, 5; 12, 3), some confused
trace of the identity of the ‘pagus' with
the ‘hundred’ as an aggregate of ‘ vici'
(see Introd. p. 23).

magno corpore, ‘by their great
mass’: cp. ‘corpus. . . . Germaniae'
(H. 4 64, 2), ‘populi corpus‘ (Liv. ι,
8‚1),&c.

3. caput, ‘the leading nation.’

4. Langobardos. This name is
generally taken to mean ‘the long-
beards,' but by some as ‘the long axes!
They were attacked by Tiberius (Vell.
a. 106, a), and probably driven across

the Elbe by him, and were afterwards
subject to but revolted from (A. 2. 45, r)
Maroboduus (c. 42, a), and supported
a Romauized king of the Cherusci (A.
rr. 17, 5), part of whose territory they
probably afterwards acquired. They
appear at this time to have occupied
a district ou both sides of the Elbe, bor-
dered west and south by the Chauci,
Cherusci, and Semnones, and answering ·
to parts of Mecklenburg and north·
eastern Hanover, where the name Bar-
danwic (near Liineberg) preserves a
trace of them. The importance of the
name in south Germany dates from the
middle of the fifth century, and their
kingdom in Italy lasted lor two ceu—
tnries from an. 568.

paucitas nobilitat, a contrast to
the Semnones, whose ‘magnum corpus’
made them ‘nobilissimi’ These owed
their distinction to the fact that, though
lew, they had the spirit to hold their

own among mole numerous peopleS. ’

They afterwards became very numerous.

5. proeliis at periclitando, allitera-
tire. Vell, who first mentions them,
calls them ‘gens Germana feritate fero·
cror.’

6. Reudigni (the form approved by
Mt), nowhere else mentioned, but
thought to have lived near the mouth
of the Elbe, iu and round the ¹district of
Hamburg. Mf. takes the name to be
from a root meaning σεμνός, and sup·
poseh'thhm to haye pyiesided over the

deinkie, ‘next in site‘ (on north and
east) : cp. c. 42, 1, &c

Aviones, apparently ‘islanders,’
whence they are supposed to have lived
in the islands near the mouth of the
Elbe and off Schleswig, mentioned by
Pliny (see on c. 1, 1).
