· CAP. 37, 38. 105

Germanis, sic Sueborum ingenui a servis separantur ; in aliis
gentibus seu cognatione aliqua Sueborum seu, quod saepe

eaccidit, imitatione rarum et intra iuventae spatium: apud
Sue'bos usque ad canitiem horrentem capillum retorquent, ac
saepe in ipso vertice religant; principes et ornatiorem habente

4 ea cura formae, sed innoxia; neque enim ut ament amenturve,
in altitudinem quandam et terrorem adituri bella comptius
hostium oculis emantur. ⁴

3. rarum, sc. ‘est,' ‘the practice but figures with the hair gathered into
(‘ obliquare crinem nodoque substrin· - such a knot on the crown as is here

gere ’) exists, bnt is rare, and confined
to youth.' What was really character·
· istic of the Suebi was its universality,
among all free men and at every time
of lif . Some stop differently, so as to
take ‘rarum’ as in apposition with
‘retorquent’ The causal abiatives ‘eog-
natione’ and ‘ imitatione’ give reasons
not for the practice being rare, but for
its existence elsewhere at all.

4. horrentem, ‘unkempt'

retorquent, Halm, Mr, and Z. thus
follow Madvig. Some such meaning is
required, and it hardly seems possible
to extract it, even under a figure of
rhetoric, from ‘retro sequuntur,' which
is no true equivalent to the ‘capillos . ..
retro agere’ of Quint. 11. 3, 160.

eo saepe, &a The text (see crit:
note) has been very variously treated.
It seems best (with Halm, Mn, Psamm,
Ζ.) to treet ‘solo’ as a gloss on ‘ipso‘
These who retain both words generally ·
take ‘solo’ with the force of⁴solum,’
to which others would alter it. For
other readings and interpretations see
88². Some also read, with the best
MSS, ‘religatur' It is in any case
plain that Tacitus means here to
describe a different and exceptional
mode, that oi those who, instead of
knotting the hair at the back of the
neck (ep. ‘nodo substringere‘), gather
it up on the top of the head. The
Marcomani and Quadi represented on

described are found on the column of
Trajan, and are taken by Fabretti
(syntagma, p. 16) to be possibly Suebic
auxiliaries.

5. principes, &c., ‘their chief men
(kings and nobles) wear their hair yet
more omately,’ adding artificial height
to the structure. Such a custom is
found among the princes of the Franks,
Goths, and Vandals. Cp. the descrip-
tion in Sid. Apoll. of Theodoric:
‘capitis apex rotundus, in qno paululum
a planitie frontis in verticem caesaries
refuga crispatur.' The following words
refer to these ohly; the simple knot of
ordinary men, as seen in the figures
above referred to, being too small for
any imposing effect.

6. ea eura formae, ‘in this point
they care for their personal appearance’

innoxia, explained by the following
words.

7. in altitudinem, &e.: the asyn-
deton is adversative, and the prep.
expresses result, as in c. 24, 2, &c ‘Et
terrorem’ is explanatory (‘to add to
the height and strike terror ⁹).

comptius. This emendation seems
much better than bracketing ‘ ut.' They
wear more adornment for the eyes of
their enemies, not (as Romans) for
those of the lover or mistress. Cicero
(Cata. 10, 22) describes such young
Romans, ‘pexo capillo nitidos, and
their mode of life.
