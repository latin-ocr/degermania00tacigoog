76 CORNELII TACITI DE GERMANIA

quam amicitias necesse est; nec inplacabiles durant: luitur
enim etiam homicidium certo armentorum ac pecorum numero
recipitque satisfactionem universa domus, utiliter in publicum,
quia periculosiores sunt inimicitiae iuxta libertatem.

i Convictibus et hospitiis non alia gens effusius indulget.2
quemcumque mortalium arcere tecto nefas habetur3 pro for-
tuna quisque apparatis epulis excipit. cum defecere, qui

r. neeesse εει, it is enforced by
German opinion and moral sentiment.
With them the sacredness of the family
tie and the promptness to resent inju-
ries were exceptionally strong.

neo . . . durant, ‘nor yet do they
tthe feuds) continue irreconcileable’
The reconciliation of homicide, as the
greatest of feuds (ί etiarn homicidium '),
implies that of those rising from lesser
causes.

luitur, &c lt is thought by some
that the acceptance of this satisfaction
was not compulsory upon the relatives
of the slain; and it appears not to have
always ended the feud (see note below).
The principle, however, prevuils in some
form almost as generally as that of
blood vengeance itself. Instances may
be seen in the Homeric poema, as in Il.
9. 632, soli, and the ποινὴ ἀνδρὸς ἀπο-
φθιμένου of Il. 18. 498. In old German
laws the compensation fine is called
‘werage1d,' ‘wengelt,' or ‘wbrgcldss
and is nssessed by a regular code ac·

imposing penalties for persistence in it

‘illud ex libertate vitium’ (c. 11, 3).
For a nearly similar use of ‘iuxta’ see
c. 30. 33 and another, founded chiefly
onSallnst,inA.6.13,1.

5. convictibus et hospitiis, ‘en-
tertainments and hospitalities,’ feasts to
each other, and reception of strangers.
The previous subject leads Tacitus to
speak of the treatment of those who, ·
though outside the family, were pro·
tected by custom; the bonsemaster being
responsible for the safe conduct of the
stranger to the next house. The hos·
pitality of the Germans is noted in simi·
lar terms by Caesar (6. a 3, 9): ‘hospitem
violare fas non putant; qui quaque de
cansa ad eos venerint, ab iniuria pro-
hibent, sanctos habent, hisque omnium
domus patent victusque communicatnr‘ ;
it is also illustrated from old poems,
and enforced by old law: see SS.

effusius indulget, ‘gives freer rein
to' : cp. ¹ indulge hospitio' (Verg. Aen.
4. 51).

ὁ. pro fortuna, ‘according to his
means'tso in A. 14. 21, ²3 cp. ‘for-

it is taken closely with ‘apparatis,’ ‘well-
fumished' (cp. ‘apparatis accipere epu·
lis,' Liv. ²3· 4, 3, and the substantive
in c. 14, 4; 23,1).

‘cibi' (cp. c. 24, 3). In later times
two or three nights were the limit for
which the right of hospitality could be
claimed.
