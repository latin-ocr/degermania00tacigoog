PURPOSE OF THE TREATISE 5

the ‘Dialogus' represents his Ciceronian‚ we might say that the
Germania and Agricola represent his Sallustian period·; the influence
ol that writer being traced in the plan of the latter work ¹, and
perhaps as a source ol material in the former², as well as in'the style
and language oi both ³.

When it is asked, what particular reasons may have led Tacitus to
choose this particular subject lor such separate treatment, the explana-
tion is naturally sought in those parts ol the treatise which show most
evidence of being written with a purpose: hence some have supposed,
from the descriptions ol German hardihood and courage, andos the
disasters which Rome had suffered at their hands ⁴, that he desired to
turn men’s thoughts from any idea of subjugating them ; others, that
he intended to lash the vices ol effete civilization by contrast with the
virtues ol healthy barbarism⁵; such explanations being plainly too
partial to account for the treatise as a whole, which we cannot suppose
to have been written lor the mere purpose os bringing in a few
telling passages

The abrupt beginning and ending of the work¹ have suggested the
idea that it was written lor insertion in the Histories ⁶, and was lor
some reason afterwards taken out and published separately. The
‘situs gentium' is certainly reekoned by Tacitus among the proper
subjects of history⁷3 and we have evidence of his practice in the
account of Britain in the Agricola⁸ and of the Jews in the Histories⁹, as
well as of that ol other writers ¹⁰. It is ol course impossible to suppose
that such an excursus could have been intended to extend to anything
like the length of the present treatise: it is nevertheless possible that,
while on the one hand he may have come to think that he was writing
on no such era in the relations of Rome and Germany as to warrant
more than avery brief preparatory sketeh‚ on the other, the richness ol
material, the interest ol the subject, the consciousness that he could
correct and improve upon the work of his predecessors, may have led
