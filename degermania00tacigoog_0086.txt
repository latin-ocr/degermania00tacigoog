1. Dotem, &c Tacitus is here car· 6. ipsa . . . adfert. This again is
ried away by the apparent contrast to not accurate. Records 01 ancient mar·

Roman custom. The nature 01 the
actual gists goes to show (what is sully
confirmed by other evidence), that they
were not a dowry to the wile, but a gift
(like the Homeric ἕδνα) to her parents,
purchasing her, or, more properly, pur-
chasing the ‘patria potestas' (‘ mund-
walt,' in mediaeval Latin ‘mundium ’)
over her. The Gallie women had ‘ dos,'
and a kind 01 settlement in marriage
(Caes. 6. 19,1).

a. intersunt parentes, &e The
family was summoned to approve the
betrothal and delivery 01 the wis .

munera probant, ‘examine and ac-
cept the gists! The repetition 01 ‘ mu·
nera' is considered by some an error 01
the scribe ; the anaphora 01 substantives
being rare in Tacitus, and confined to
contrasted parallel sentences (Dial. 13,
21A·1·7-7;59‚134·74›3l·Aps?-

articles 01 the tollet. ,

4. boves, &c These are paid as
value,as in the case 01 fines (c. 12, a),&c.

5. in haee munera, ‘with a view to
(‘ under condition 01 ’) these gists.’ This
force 01 ‘in’ is seen in some passages
01 Livy, as ‘in has...lcges...ictum
loedus’ (23. 34, 1); also 34. 35,1; 42.
62, 5.

riage customs show that a sword, &c.,
was given to the bridegroom, not by
the bride, but by her father or guardian,
partly as a valuable present, but chiefly,
it would seem, as a symbol to denote
that she passed under his power.

7. haec aroana saera, ‘these as their
mystic rites;' alluding to the Roman
nearly obsolete (A. 416, 2) ceremony

coniugales deos, as Hymenaeus,
Juno pronuba, &c.; a long list is given
in Preller, Romtsche Mythologie, ii.
214-119. The simple interchange 01
gists stood to Gemens instead 01 all this.

8. extra virtutum, &a ‘excluded
from aspinng to share in manly heroic
deeds.

monies.'

12. hoo. . . denuntiant, ‘give this
warning? On the presence 01 women
in war, see c. 7, 3. It has been shown
above that these gilts have probably no
such meaning. ·
