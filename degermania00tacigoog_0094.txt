CAP. 22, 23. 79

23. Potui humor ex hordeo aut frumento, in quandam
similitudinem vini corruptus: proximi ripae et vinum mer-
cantur. cibi simplices agrestia poma, recens fera aut lac
concretum: sine apparatu, sine blandimentis expellunt famem.

tion is due to the desire to make the
contrast as pointed as possible, and
some reasonable qualification may be
readily understood.

1. Potui, sc. ‘est' This predicative
dative, expressing that which a thing or
person serves as, or occasions, is com-
mon in Tacitus, most frequently in forms
in ‘ui,' as ‘victui,' ‘vestitui’ (c. 46, 3),
‘derisui’ (Agr. 39, ag, ‘inrisui' (H. 1.
7, 5), ‘indutui' (A. 1 . 4, ο), ‘obtentui'
(H. 1. 49, 6, &c.), ‘ostentui’ (A. 15.
64, 2, &c.).

frumento, probably for the specific
term ‘tritico’ (wheat); but it has been
doubted whether the Germans then had
it. Mead from honey seems to have
been known to all Aryan speaking
peoples (T aylor, 170) , and intoxicating
driuk from grain was known to many
nations and had many nomes, as ‘zy-
thum’ in Egypt, ‘caelia' and ‘cerea’
in Spain, ‘cervesia’ in Gaul, &a (Plin.
aa. 25, 82,164). The old forms of the
words ‘ beer' and ‘ale’ may be native
German, but their claim is questioned.
‘Barleywine’ was the common drink of
the Kelts (Garris) as late as the time of
Julian, whose epigram upon it is pre-
served (Anth. Pal. ix. 368; see also
Mommsen, Hist. v. Ε. T. ’1 108).

2. corruptus, ‘fermented ’; the idea
appears to be that of decomposition or
change of nature. K. would take it as
equivalent to ‘in similitudinem vini
corrupti faetus!

et vinum mercantur. This impor-
tation was forbidden in Caesar’s time

by the Suebi (4 a, 6 , as also by the
Gallie Nervii (2.16,4 . 882. notes the
German words for wine and all con·
nected with winemaking as foreign.

3. cibi, &c It is shown in the fol·
lowing notes that the account of their
food is very defective.

agrestia poma, nucultivated and un-
grafted apples, such as grew in fields
rather than gardens (see note on c. 5, 1).
Such were part of a simple diet even in
Italy (A. 15. 45, 6). The Gerrnans are.
known at that time to have had other
wild fruits, berries, nuts, &a ; also some
kinds of vegetables, as beans and edible
roots¹

Rome, to become tender. Ι1 hunting
was rare tc. 15, 1), this sood must haye
been exceptional, and they must also
have eaten the flesh of domestic animals,
birds, and fish. The statement of Mela
(3. 3, 28) that they ate raw meat, both
fresh aud dried on the skin, is perhaps
true of the latter only; such dried meat
being even now not unknown in some

arts.
p lac concretum (cp.Verg. G. 3, 463),
‘ curdled milk ' 1ί dicke Milch '). Caesar
says of the Suebi 14. 1, 8) ‘maximam
partem laete atque pecore vivunt,’ and
of the Germans in general (6. 22,1)
⁴ maior pars victus in' lacte, caseo, carne
consistit'; butthenameforcheese (Kaise)
would show it to be of foreign origin.
NeitherCaesar nor Tacitus speaks of the
oatmeal pulse, mentioned by Pliny (see
on c. 5, 1) as a chief article of German
food.

4. apparatu: cp. c'. 14, 4 ; here used
of sumptuous luxuries, and further ex-
plained by ‘ blandimentis,’ ‘provocatives
to appetite,' the ‘irritamenta gulae' of
Sall. Jugsan 7, or the ‘qualia lassum
pervellunt stomachum’ of Hor. Sat. 2.
