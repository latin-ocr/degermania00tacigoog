licatae enim pudicitiae nulla venia: non forma, non aetate,
3non opibus maritum invenerit. nemo enim illic vitia ridet,
nec corrumpere et corrumpi saeculum vocatur. melius quidem
adhuc eae civitates, in quibus tanturn virgines nubunt et

piunt maritum quo modo unum corpus unamque vitam, ne
ulla cogitatio ultra, ne longior cupiditas, ne tamquam maritum,
bsed tamquam matrimonium ament. numerum liberorum
finire aut quemquam ex adgnatis necare flagitium habetur,
plusque ibi boni mores valent quam alibi bonae leges.

20. In omni domo nudi ac sordidi in hos artus in haec

2. invenit C c.

ties permitted in either case (see note
above), or that they became more severe
after his time.

1. aetate, ‘youth ’: the ablativos are
causal.

a. invenerit. The subject can be
supplied irorn the sense.

3. corrumpere et corrumpi, so
coupled in Α. 14. ao, 5. ,

saeculum, ‘the spirit ol the age,'
way os the world.

melius, sc. ‘agunt ἐ verbs of motion
or action, as well as os speaking, arc
osten omitted by Tacitus. Cp. Agr.
19, 23 ‘vos quidem istud pro me’ (H.
1. 84, 1) ‘melius . . . ille' (A. 1. 43, ι),
&a ‘Adhuc' adds force to the com-
parative (‘better still'), as in c. 29, 3,
and has often the sense oi ‘further'
<ep c. 10, 3), like ἔτι.

4, in quibus, &e There is later
evidence that among some the widow
was expected to hang herself, or to burn
on the husband’s pile, like the Indian
Suttee. and that the marriage os widows,
even where not forbidden, was thought
dishonourable. This is, oi course, a
still stronger eontrast to Roman custom.

5. spe votoque, ‘the hope and as-
piration' os married lif .

semel transigitur, ‘they have done
with. once sor all': cp. ‘transigite cum
expeditionibus’ (Agr. 54, 4).

sic, answering to‘ quomodo' (⁴ so . . .
as'), as in Agr. 34, a; Dial. 36, 8; A.
4. 35, 33 16. 31, 2, &c., and in Cic.

6. ne,sc. ‘sit'z cpe. 13, 3‚&c.

7. ultra, beyond oue marriage.

ne tamquam, &c., ‘that her love

may be, as it were, not for the husband,
but for the married state': that she
should love her husband not merely as
a man, but rather as elevating ber to
the permanent dignity of a matron.
‘Tamquam' has constantly in Tacitus
the iorce os ὡς, here rather that of ὡς
εἰπεῖν, as qualifying a strong statement.
Meiser would read ‘tam maritum quam,¹
others omit the second ‘ tamquam'

8. numerum . . . finire, ‘ to prevent
an increase’ (Juv. 6, 595).

9. adgnatis = ἐπιγόνοις, children hom
aiter there is already an heir z so in H.
5. 5, 5, where a similar prohibition
among the Jews is mentioned. Tacitus
appears here to overstrain the contrast;
for it cau be shown that the German
father sometimes exercised power to
kill, expose, or sell (cp. A. 4. 72, 4)
his children. But no doubt the expo·
sure oi iniants was much rarer than at
Rome, perhaps especially rare among
the best-known tribes, and, is not sor-
bidden, contrary to sentiment.

ιο. morea . . ¹leger, so opposed in
Hor. Od. 3. 24, 35. The German sanc·
tity of custom is contrasted with the
futility of such laws as the ‘lex Papia
Poppaea' at Rome (see A. 3. 26, 1, foll).
No written German laws appear to be
certainly traceable earlier than the Salic
oi the fifth century.

11. in omni domo, even those of the
wealthy classes. The subject oi the
bringing up oi children is suggested by
the last sentence os the preceding chap-
ter.

nudi. The word is here more cap·
