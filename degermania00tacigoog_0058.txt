(cp. c. 4.1). From comparison of ‘in
tumultum evaluit’ (H. 1. 80, 3), some
would here read ‘in ' for ‘non'

1. aviotore. The prep. is best taken
in the sense of tut, not πό, answering
to ‘a seipsis’ below. Tacitus is seek·
ing to explain how the name ‘Germani‚'
originally applied to the CisRhenane,
cameto be extended to me TransRhe·

whom they had dispossessed‚ by repre·
senting the whole race beyond the Rhine
as their kinsmen, and having no other
common nemeto apply to them called
them by ὼε newly devised name which
they had themselves assumed, and this
name the latter also (as these authori-
ties suppose) adopted. ‘Ob metum’
bas certainly thus a very opposite sense
to its elsewhere invariable meaning,
‘by reason of tear: ‘because they were
afraid'(A.1. 1.5; 68, 2; H. 2. 49,6;
65, 3, &c.); but‘ob’ is used in a final
sense in other nearly parallel· expres-
sions, as ‘ ob praedam ' (H. 1. 63, 1, &c.)‚
‘ob praemium' (A. 1. 3, 6, &c.), ‘ob
id' (A. 13, 5, 2), &c Some have altered
‘victore’ to ‘vict0,' others make the
words mean that the Gauls ‘by reason
of their fear called all the others after
the name of the victor': but these seem
to lead to still greater difficulties.

2. a eorpus, taken closely with ‘vo-
carentur' There does not seem to be
any sufficient evidence that the Germans
beyond the Rhinc really called thern-
selves by this name collectively.

3. Fuisse. . . memorant. From the
use of ‘eos' most commentators infer
that the subject is the ‘quidam' of the
last chapter; but the change in ‘canunt'
would be thus so awkward, that it seems
better to take the subject to be ‘Ger-
mani’ as in ‘celebrant’ (c. 2, 3), and to

Herculem. The personality here
mentioned as sung ol before battle as the
‘prototype of breve men‚' and whose
achievements are thus held up as the
pattem to warriors, seems to differ from
that conceived as one of the great gods
iu c.9‚ 1 (where see note); but it is
to be observed‚ that the divine and
heroic type are strongly intermingled
in German mythology. On the whole
subject see Introd. pp. 27, 28, and note
on c. 34, 2.

4. eunt illis, &a From here to
‘ intumescat’ we have what in modern
writing would be a footnote, describing
not apparently the warsougs before
spoken of (‘canunt'), but something
suggested by and to be distinguished
from them, a kind of battle chaut called
loosely ‘carmina’ beginning probably
with some sentences orwords but ending
evidently in inarticulate cries like the
ἀλαλητόςε cp. ‘cantu truci' (H. 2. 22,
2; also 4. 18, 5.); ‘laeto cantu aut
truci sonore' (A. 1. 65,1).

5. bueo. Much of tlte difficulty of
the passage lies in this pronoun. If it
be taken as = ‘ea,’ ‘talia‚' ‘ eiusmodi,'
we should expect a subjunctive ; and the
alternative interpretation, ‘those well
knowu,' would seem to require ‘illa'
(the parallel cited from c. 20,1 being .
hardly apposite), for which it is per-
haps substituted as ‘illis’ immediately
precedes. The word may be corrupt;
but the substitutions ‘alia' (Z.),‘heroica‚’
or ‘bellica’ (Halm), and ‘in acie‚' as a
contrast to ‘ituri, &c.' (Hachtmann), are
unsatisfactory.

harditum. This reading is best
supported, and the explanation from

suppose this to be a stronger instance of ‘bardhi’ (= ‘ scutum '), as ‘ shield song‚'

such use of ‘is' for the reflexive as is

suits the context. Some have erroneously
