70 CORNELII TACITI DE GERMANIA

seras et detracta velamina spargunt maculis pellibusque be-
luarum, quas exterior Oceanus atque ignotum mare gignit.
nec alius feminis quam viris habitus, nisi quod feminae saepius 3
lineis amictibus velantur eosque purpura variant, partemque
tvestitus superioris in manicas non extendunt, nudae brachia
ac lacertos3 sed et proximagpars pectoris patet. quamquaml
severa illic matrimonia, nec ullam morum partem magis
laudaveris. nam prope soli barbarorum m'ngulis uxoribus
contenti sunt, exceptis admodum paucis qui non libidine,
10 sed ob nobilitatem pluribus nuptiis ambiuntur.

9. ob libidinem C.

ruder tribes could not then weave sor
themselves.
ut quibus, &c ‘as those do who

, have,’ &c Cp. the similar ellipse in

c.22‚1;andtheuseof ‘ut’iuc.2,4,
&c6 For the sense os ‘cultus,’ cp.
c. ,2.

1. detracta, sc.‘ seris’: sor ‘velamina'

‘vellecrlra¹ or ‘ velumina ’ have been sug·
este .

g maculis pellibusque, hendiadys for
‘maculatis pellibus? They sew on
illibi} tillir} vgsslglpljgffi‘gff
loribus alas’ (Verg. Aen. 7, 191).

2. exterior Oceanus, explained by
‘ignotum mare’; probably the Baltic
is meant. The tradere in this region
would be the Suiones of c. 44, 2.

3. habitus, so used ol clothing in
Agr. 21, 3; A. 1. 69, 5. &c

4. amictibus, distinguished by some
from ‘ vestitus‚' as the ‘ sagum ’ from the
‘vestis’ but more probably intended as
a general tlenp to mean thplt the matefriial

⁴ T hat the Germans spun llax at this time
is attested by Pliny (19.1, 2, 8), and
implements for spinuing aud weaving
are as old in Europe as the Swiss lake-
dwellings (Taylor, p. 171).

purpura, a border or stripes of some
colour resembling purple dye.

5. vestitus, the tunic, as distinct
from the ‘braccae'; ‘superioris’ by
enallage (cp. c. 27, a) ior ‘superiorem
partem,' the part to which sleeves would
be attached in the case os the men.
Such seems to be the contrast best suited

ιρ. plurimis all, text Halm. ambiunt H.

to the passage, though 58². takes the
comparison to be ratherwith the ‘ stola*
ol Roman women. On the Antonine
column the women are represented with
an undergarment reaching to the ieet,
and a short tunic over it. This tunic
has usually long sleeves, but in some
instances (see Bartoli, pl. 17, 49, 63)
exactly answers to the description here

given.

brachia ac lacertos, the iore-arm
and arm.

6.'sed et: cp. c. 8, 3.

quamquam, i. e. although their cloth-
ing may seem barely decent, their chas-
tity is remarkable. This forms the
transition to a new subject. This word
is so used in the principal sentence with
the force ol ‘however' in Dial. 28, 3;
33, 5·

8. prope soli barbarorum. This
statement is somewhat bold and does
not hold good of all Germans. SS.
shows that polygamy was not forbidden
by their ancient laws, nor unusual in

north Germany, besides being excep-
tionally practised elsewhere, as Tacitus
notes.

9. exceptis, &c.‚ as an instance,

Ariopstus had two wives (Caes. 1.
53r4·

libidine, causal abl. answe'ring to
‘ob nobilitatem'
10. pluribus, ‘more than one ἐ most

edd. retain ‘ plurimis' (‘ several ').

ambiuntur, so ‘conubiis ambirc'
(Verg. Aen. 7, 333); ‘auxiliis ambiri'
(H. 4. 51, a). Here it is used with
‘libidine' by zeugma, in the sense oi
‘ plures uxores habeut'
