part ol the name denotes boldness, the Staatsr. iii. 600.
lormer part may have an intensive force
ormayimplydescent fromlrmin. Their
frontier towards Rome was not plat

Raetian part oi the ‘limes' (see on
c. 29, 4), and their territory appears
mainly to coincide with parts oi Fran-
couia and north-eastem Bavan‘a, ex-
tending further to the middle Elbe.
They are known to Vell. (2.106, a),
and Strab. (7. 1, 3, 290) ns on the Elbe
or beyond it, but were settled in what
had been the Marcomanic territory by
Domitius about nc. a (Dio,55.1o‚ a, 2),
whence their friendship for Rome: see

name is not known aiter the Marco·
manic war, but they may be represented
by the later Thuringians.

2. non in ripa, not merely on the
Danube bank, in eontrast to ‘penitus'
‘sar within the frontier.'

3. in splendidissima. . . colonia.
lt is plain that Augusta Vindelicorum
(Augsburg) is meant, a town founded
by Augustus, but not otherwise known
as a colony, and called ‘municipium'
in an inscription (Marqu. Staatsv. i. 289,
who thinks Tacitus may only mean to
call it a Roman town). Its wealth and
importanee are attested by sculptures‚
inscriptions, &c (F riedl. iii. 167).

4. passim sine custode, ‘every-
where (instead of at stated points only)
and without a guard set over them!
This privilege may be understood lrom
the complaint of the Tencteri to the

oum,‘whereas’: cp. e 36,3.

6. non concupiscentibus. The
word seems too strong to mean only
‘not desiring to see them,' and would
rather mean ‘not hankering after them’ ¹
in the way of plunder, as Germaus geue·
rally would.

Albis. This name appears to be
German, from a root similar to that in
‘Albunea’ dre, signiiying ‘the white
(or bright) stream.¹ It rises in Bobe-
mia, which is certainly not within the
territoryof the Hermunduritsee c.4a,1).
The most probable supposition is fflet
a braneh‚ as the Thuringian Saale, has
beep here coniounded with the Elbe
itse i.

7. notum, known by exploration.
Tacitus refers to the expedition oi Dru·
sus in nc. 9, and that oi Tiberius in
nn. 4, 5 (see onc.1,1; 34,1), andto
the crossing of the upper Elbe by L.
Domitius (see A. 444, 3). It had been
the plan oi Augustus to make it the
frontier, but this was frustrated by the
destruction oi Varus.

auditur, ‘known by hearsay': cp.
‘arma. ..audita’ (c. 37, a). Tacitus
speaks regretiully, but he certainly was
not in favour oi a iorward poliey in
Germany (see Introd. p. 6).

8. Naristi, so Halm aud Pramm.,
with support from Dio, 71. 213 others
follow Mf. in reading ‘Varisti,’ which
he supports from Ptol. a. 11, 23 and as
havingan etymological meaning (⁶ most
warlike'). They are takentohavebeen

Agrippinenses (H. 4. 64, 2) that they a branch oi the Marcomani left in the
had to deal ‘inermes ac prope nudi, Baireuth district oi Bavaria and the
sub custode et pretio,’ disarmed, almost Fichtelgebirge.
