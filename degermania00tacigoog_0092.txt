tion’ (between invited and uninvited):
cp. ‘notum ignotumque,' &c below.
This indiscriminateness of hospitality
is characteristic of ancient civilization,
and grows out of its circumstances:
without it, travelling would have been
impossible. It can be illustrated abun-
dantly from the Homeric poerns, and
from many other sources, and has its
counterpart now in scantily peopled
countries‚ though in strong contrast to
medem society generally, or to the
Rome of Tacitus.

r. quantum ed, ‘ sofar as concerns'
(=‘quantum attinet ad’); so in Agr.
44‚3; H.5. 10,3; perhaps taken from
Ov. A. A. 1, 744 f‘qnantum ad Piri·
thoum ').

2. abeunti. Such gifts to the guest
on departure, and the asking for thern,
are illustrated from the Nibelnngenlied;
the old German name for thern is ‘letzi'
(SS.). Such ξεινήια are constantly men·
tioned in the Homeric poems.

moris: cp. c. 13, 1.

3. facilitas, ‘freedom from con·
straint’ z so ‘ facilis' is used in the sense
of ‘frank' in Agr. 40, 4; A. 3. 8, 4,
&c

gaudent, emphatic, as in c. 5, 2.

4. imputant, ‘reckon as a favour.‘
The giver expects no return, the receiver
leels no obligation. ,

vietus inter hospites comis. This
sentence could possibly be taken as sum·
ming up the passage (‘ the whole social
life of gnestlriends is courteous'), but
seems so weak and out of place that it
has been generally either bracketed or
altered. Some, by reading ‘communis'

4. [victus. . . comis] so bracketed
6. statim enirn Bb¹.

for ‘comis' make it a reminiscence of
the ‘victusque communicatur’ of Caes.
(see above). The ‘vinculum inter hos-
pites comitas' of Lachmann (which SS.
adopts) is somewhat violent and hardly
apposite; ‘victus inter honestiores co-
mites ¹ (Mr.) would give a meaning only
rme in special cases, where a ‘comita-
tus’ existed, and it is perhaps best to
regard the sentence as interpolated from
amarginal summary of the passage.
The preceding sentence seems to close
the subject.

6. quem plerumque, &c., in con-
trast to the Romans who usually rose
before daybreak.

7. saepius aalide. ln view os other
statements (as Caes. 41, 103 6. 21, 5;
Herodian, 7. 2,12) that the Germans'
bath was the river, and the abundant
evidence of their fondness for swimming
(A. 2. 8, 3), it hasbeen thought that
Tacitus is wrong; but his words may
well be true of the daily ablutions of
most Germans during most part of the
year (‘saepius'). For the use ol ‘ut,'
cp. c. 17, 2.

plurimum, sc. ‘tem oris' (c. 15, r).

8. separatae, &c his also is con-
trary to Roman custom. It has been
thought that the latter part ol the state·
ment is an error arising from the use of
the same German words sor a table and
a dish (cp. ‘Tisch ¹ from Latin ‘discus');
but separate tables as well as separate
seats are found used by Greeks in early
times (Od. 17, 333; 22, 74, dcc).

9. convivia3 besides public, there
were often family feasts to celebrate
births, marriages, &c
