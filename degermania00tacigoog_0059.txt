connected it with the Gallio ‘bardi'
(on whom see Lucan, 1, 444). Those
who read ‘baritus’ cite the use of ‘bar-
ritus' in Ammianus aud Vegetius ( g.

‘voce Martia concinentes, quem appe-
taurinatum: Amm. 31. 7, 11) ofa
war-cry of this character.

sonuit acies, so iu H. 4 18, 5.

3. vocis . . .videtur. This reading
is adopted by most recent edd. ‘The
unison seems one of valour rather than
of mere sound’ The expression merus
suggested by ‘melior actionum qnam
sononrm concentus’ (Cic Off. 1. 40,
145). The MSS. text maybe taken (with
CB) to mean ‘these shouts do not so
much seem articulate souuds as a general
cry of valour.’

4. fractum, so used of sounds by
Vergil (G. 4, 72; Aen. 3, 556), where
some explain it of the intermittent or
successive, others of the crashing char·
acter of trumpet blasts or wave souuds
The latter passage is the more apposite,
as Ammianus (16. 12, 43) describes the
‘barritus' as ‘ clamor . .. a tenui susurro
exoriens paulatimque adulescens ritu. . .
fluctuum cautibus illisorum.'

He here obviously refers to Greek or
Roman antiquaries, following German
or Celtic legeuds of a wandering god or

hero, and tixiug them to a spot by some
local beliefs or resemblance of names.
Many such extensions of the odysseus
myth are noted, bringing him to Iberia,
Caledonia, Lusitania, &c The German
wanderer is probably Wuodan; see
Introd. p. 27.

opinantur. This verb is used by
Tacitus only here and four times in

Ulixen. This name, corrupted into
‘Ulysses,' represents the form iu which
Odyssens was known to the Sicilian
Greeks, and through them to the
Romans.

‘fabulosus Hydaspes' i Hor. od. 1. 22,

hunc, ie. the German. The writer
as it were transporta himself to the spot.

8. Asciburgium, mentioned in H.
4. 33, 1, and evidently not far from
Vetera; generally taken to be Asburg,
near the Rhine, and near Moerst but
by some to be Esseuburg, near Duisburg.
The name is German (‘ship station‚'
from ‘Esche’ = ‘ ash ’), and may have
been given by the Cugerni (H.4. 26, 4),
who had dispossessed the Menapians
(Caes. 4. 4). Professor Rhys (Hibbert
Lectures, p. 289) inclines to connect it
with the myth os the man named ‘Ash’
created by Wuodan (see on c. 2, 3).

situm, sc. ‘est ἐ some prefer to make
it a participle, and to take ‘hodieque'
as ‘hodie quoque,‘ as in Vell. 1. 4, 2,
