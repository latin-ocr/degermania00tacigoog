1. sacerdoti: apparently a male
priest is meant. Conversely, the cha·
riot of Freyr appears to have been
driven by a virgin priestess. lt is plain
from ξ 5, that the slaves also touched
the chariot during the ceremonies.

penetrali. Some take this os the
chariot, others os the innermost recess
os the forest, as also ‘templo' below;
but perhaps the latter word, as also the

mention os ⁸ Tamianae templum’ (A. r.
51, a), shows that the statement in c. 9, 3
requires some qualification.

Ι a. bubus seminis, the usual expres-

8. numen ipsum, i. e. something
alleged to be the deity itsels; probably
not an image, but some symbol or fetish.
Tacitus would imply that this supersti-
