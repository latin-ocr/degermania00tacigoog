SOURCES OF INFORMATION 13

subject ¹, though to what extent, or in what part of his work, or in
connexion with what events, it is not easy to say. It is more im·
portant to note that Livy, our historian's other chief model, had
prefixed to his narrative of Caesar’s war with Ariovistus an excursus
described in terms very similar to the title which Tacitus is thought to
have given to his own work ².

His other sources ofinformation are unknown to us but may well have
been very numerous, Germans were often seen at Rome, and many
Romans had been brought in contact with many tribes as officials
in the provinces on the Rhine, or as traders in the interior. Even
the distant north-east had lately been opened up by the amber traffie
resulting from Roman luxury ³. The results of all this observation
had probably occupied the minds of many antiquaries whose specu· ¹
lations are traceable in several places throughout the work ⁴.
