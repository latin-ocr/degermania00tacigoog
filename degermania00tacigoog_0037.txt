reckless gambling, are described as not kept, but sold abroad¹.
Freedmen also constitute a distinct class, of whom he only tells us
that, while insignificant elsewhere, and little above the slave, they
became extremely influential under kings⁸. lt must be assumed that
they at least resembled the bondsman in exclusion lrom the franchise,
and had no independent status apart lrom their lord or patron.
Another intermediate class, ol whom Tacitus tells us nothing, would
be the ‘ingenui’ who had no land, and had to work as free labourers

Any identity in blood between the members of villages would naturally
be shortlived, and the tie would become political only, as in ‚its
counterpart‚ the English ‘township¹⁰.’ The most important feature
in the German ‘vicus’ at this date is that the free village community
was possessor ol the land ¹¹, apportioning it in some way among
occupiers, and that it had a court ¹² or council ol its own, which must
have been competent to settle disputes on these or other local matters.
