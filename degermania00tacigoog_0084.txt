3. sigula b.

2. fallunt=kav66vra The expression
is somewhat rhetorical, and some (see
Mr.) would alter it, but the meaning is
that the enemy is either wholly un·
aware of the existence of such places or
has not time to search for them.

3. tegumen, &c The account in
Tacitus of German dress would repre-
sent an advance since Caesar’s time, who
speaks of the Suebi (4.1‚10) and the
Germans generally (6. 21, 5) as having
only a very scanty clothing of skins.

Ι The Marcomani and Quadi on the An·
tonine column are generally represented
with ‘braccae' sleeved tunic. and ‘sa- ’
gum,' but sometimes one of the two
latter is absent (see Bartoli's plates).
Orelli cites from Sidonius (Epp. 4. ao)
a minute account of the dress and arms
of a traiu of German princes in the fifth
century.

sagum (cp. c. 6, a), said to be a
Celtic word, and used by the Romans
of the military cloak, a mantle clasped
in sront and leaving the arms free.
A similar cloak of woven material was
worn by many others, especially by
GauIs, and was sometimes of various
colours (H. 2. 20,1; 5. 23,1; Verg.
Aen. 8, 660). The Scottish plaid and
Spanish cloak are its survivals.

fibula; such clasps are always found
in German tombs, and at a later date
were often ol costly workmanship. Τὴε
expression ‘tegumen spina consertum'
is from Verg. Aen. 3, 594.

4. cetera (cp. c. 29, 3; 45, 9), taken
closely with ‘intecti ' (on the probable
reminiscence of Sall. see Introd. p. 13,
note tl: cp. ‘ nudi aut sagulo leves ’ (c. 6,
2); ‘nudis corporibus’ (H. 2. 22, a). Ii
is at least meant that indoors they had
no other clothing.

7. femnt B b¹, gerunt C c bl.

totos dies, &c The halfclad Ger-
mans huddling all day round the tire
are contrasted with the out-of-door lise
of the Italians.

5. locupletissimi, &c This seu-
tence seems plainly in contrast to ‘te-
gumen omnibus sagum,' and to mean ,
that the sleeved tunic and ‘ braccae' were
confined to the rich. Recent edd. gene-
rally follow Mf. in taking it to mean
that the rich were distinguished, not by
having such underclothing (which all
had), but by its stuff and quality. This
meaning seems against the sense of the
passage as a whole, though, no doubt,
more in accordance with the facts (see
note on l. 3). Among the Gauls at the
time of the second Punic war, some
went to battle without such clothing,
but voluntarily and out of bravado
(Polyb. 2. 28, 8, 30).

6. striota, close-fitting: see the quo·
tation given by Or. from Sidonius.

7. gerunt et, ‘there are those also
who wear! This, which is stated by
Caesar to be the universal clothing of
the nation (see on § 1), seems here
spoken of as not worn by all, but as
found among the nearer as well as
the more distant tribes. Itis possibly
meant that it formed the outdoor un·
derclothing of those who could not
aflord the ‘vestis’ Cp. Vergil’s de·
scription of northern natious (G. 3, 383):
‘pecudum fulvis velantur corpora

Rhine or Danube.

8. exquisitius, explained by ‘eli-
gunt' They care more about the skins
which they wear, as they are less able
to get any other material. Possibly the
