THE ACCOUNT GIVEN ΒΥ TACITUS 21

non in the choice ol a king, conferred otherwise no political privi-
lege ¹, and that no other rulers ol the people were necessarily chosen
lrom its ranks. Such rulers or magistrates are designated as ‘prin-
cipes' and are described as chosen by the ‘concilium’ ol the state
to preside judicially in its local subdivisions² (see below, p. 23).
They 'are probably the sarn'e who collectively form an inner council
or senate ³, to decide lesser matters and to hold previous debate on
greater, belore their submission to the general body ; and who dele-
gate one ol their number to the supreme command in war ⁴. They
are probably, again, the same who are spoken of as partly supported
by quasi-voluntary giltsl, and as having the important privilege ol
keeping up and leading to battle a train of ‘comites' (see below,
p. 25). In this description, as far as it goeS, we clearly recognize
the person known later as ‘heretoga,' ‘herzog' or ‘duke' in war, and
as ‘ealdorman’ or ‘graf' in peace⁶ ; however wide the guli that sepa-
rates the freely-chosen magistrates of a democracy from those who in
> later times are chosen by the king, are hereditary, and osten take the
title of the ‘Earl' or ‘ ]ar1⁷.’ '

Below the plebs of ‘ingenui' are the unsree⁸, respecting whom
Tacitus seems to be betrayed into inaccuracy in his anxiety to point

a contrast to Rome. Domestic slaves may probably not have been
numerous, so that he ignores thern altogether where we should most
expect him to mention them ⁰, and describes to us only an extremely
mitigated form ol bondagc on the land, or seridom, which he compares
to the condition of a Roman ‘colonus ¹⁰,' representing the bondsman
as living in his own house on his allotted parcel of land, subject only
