5), ‘in sapientiam cessit' (c. 36, 2), ‘in medio relinquam'(c. 46, ⁶),
119 Among writers nearer to his own time, he seems to have bor-
rowed from Seneca¹ the somewhat fanciful figure 'sepulchrum caespes
erigit' (c. 27, 3), perhaps ‘diem disponere’ (c. 30. 2), ‘crinem
submittere’ (c. 31,1). ,

This brief sketch of the style of this treatise would be incomplete
without some notice of the literary skill with which transition is made
from one part of the subject to another without apparent disconnexion
(seenotesonc.5,r; 6,1; 8‚3; 13,1; 15.1; 1324: 291).

SOURCES OF INFORMATION.

Tacitus lays no claim to independent knowledge gathered by travel
in the country, but rather professes to state what he has ‘received ².'
Of previous writers he expressly mentions Caesar alone, and him once
only ³. He is thought to have followed him in some other places
alsn', but in general must have tested on later authorities, who had in
many points corrected and extended the slight and mostly hearsay
knowledge of that date. ln a few places he shows signs of having
studied the geographical work of Pomponius Mela (A.1›.50)⁵‚in a
somewhat larger number he appears to follow the ‘Naturalis Historia’
of Pliny ⁶, but seldom without additional details from other sources.
