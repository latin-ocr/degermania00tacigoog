tion alter asyndeta here introduces a
characteristic of a different kind and
greater importance.

1. Suionum. This name, connected
through intermediate forms with that
ol ‘Swede,’ is here a general name sor
all the Germanicpeoples ofScandinavia.
They are viewed as consisting of many
subdivisions (‘ civitates'), bnt as Ger-
mans (cp. ‘ceteros Germanos’ ξ 4) and
Suebiantc.46, 1). ·

hino, looking from the coast of the
Rugii and Lemovii.

ipso in Oceano, in the midst of it,
as islands: some prefer the reading
‘ipsae' (ie. by themselves). Pliny
speaks (4. ¹13, 27, 96) os ‘Scatinavia'
iiiiih¹f¹32¹l0tii3¹3¹¹thtutti
large and three small islands. and a
similar opinion was prevalent ior some
time later.

praetor: cp. c. a, 2.

3. utrimque, attributive with‘prora’
(cp. c. 8, 1, &c.i: ‘their double prow
presents a frent, &c Such vessels
were employed by Germanicus (A. 2.
6, 2), and were in use among other
natibus (cp. Hi 3. 47, 53 Plin. 6. aa,
24, 82), and such still survive in coast
districts of Sweden. A large beatos
this form, belonging to the iron age,
and found in a peat bog in Jutland, is
figured and described in Green, Illus-
trated Hist. ol Eng. i. 11.

adpulsui, ‘ for pntting to land ’; so
‘adpellere’ in A. and Η. l. l.

4. ministrent. Most recent edd.
adopt this reading as a probable re-
miniscence of Vergil, Aen. 6, 307 ; 10,
218, where the question is still leit open

(see Conington’s note) whether ‘velis’
is datos the thing served, or abl. in·
stnrm. (as it would clearly be here with
the MSS. text ‘ministrantur ’). Cp. the ·
combination of both in H. 1. 48, 5
(¹ Vinio fictilibus ministrari iubet ¹).

in ordinem, ‘so as to lorm a regular
row.’

5. solutum, ‘the oars are loose,' so
asto be shifted easily, not secured to
the boat

quibusdam fluminum = ‘quibus-
dam fluminibus’ (cp. c. 43, 2, 6).

utres posuit: cp. c. 35, 4, &n

6. est . ..et opibus honos, ‘these

people pay respect even to wealth,’ in .

contrast to what is said of Germans

generally (c. 5, 2-4). μ
7. eoque unus imperitat, i.e. be·

cause he is preeminently rich. The ·

iring’s power seems really to have rested
on a religious ground (see note below),
and his wealth was probably rather
effect than cause.

nullis iam exceptionibus, ‘here
with no reservations,’ such as are noted
inc.7,1-a; 11,5; and even in c.44.r.

non precario, &c., ‘witha claim
to obedience not merely on sufferance';
so ‘precarium . . . imperium’ (H. 1.
52, 6), and the adv. in Agr. 16, 5.
‘Iure parendi' appears to have a strained
meaning (‘ the right to be obeyed'),
and Passow would read ‘imperandi'
SS. gives the view of a Swedish his·
torian, that the Scandinavian royal
power was not really unlimited, but
might seem so to an outsider, being
enhanced by the idea ol divine deseent,
and by a hereditary priesthood. The
accounts ol this distant people are
