THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BV TACITUS 23

It is only in a few sentences that we learn anything of the aggre-
gate of ‘vici’ forming the ‘pagus¹,’ represented to us as also ajudieial
centre, and as fumishing its hundred jurors to the court ², and its
hundred picked warriors to the host ³. lt is most commonly identi-
fied with the German ‘Gau' or English ‘shire ⁴,' but, if so, apparently
with earlier and smaller divisions under such names than those which
are historically best known to us ⁶. There is much probability in the
view that the ‘pagus' was really the ‘hundred ⁶,' known to us later
as the chief centre of judicial administration whether criminal or
civil under its presiding ‘ealdorman’ and jurors'. The ‘hundred'
as well as the village, was probably at first an aggregate of persons
or families rather than of territorial districts ⁸, and had lost its
numerical signifieance before we have authentic record of it ⁰.

We have no mention of any division at that time answering to the
province, or to the English shire as later understood 10; the only
gathering above the ‘pagus’ being the great ‘concilium' of the
‘civitas’ the ‘allthing' or ‘folkmoot’ at which all magistrates were
elected, the youth of the nation were solemnly invested with arms ¹¹,
