1. electi, better than their· own
usually were (c. 6, 3).

magna arma. Some would read
‘magnifica' or even ‘insignia' ; but it is
easy to take it to mean massive shields
and cuirasses, suitable to their stature,
possibly also huge offensive weapons,
as spears and swords.

phalerae.. . torques. These em·
bossed plates or discs and collars are
often mentioned as military decorations
os Roman soldiers (Juv. 16, 60, δια).

iam et . . . docuimus, ‘we have now
even taught them· (cp. c. 42, 2), as
a lesson of Roman avarice.

pecuniam. He is not here speaking
os trade, as in c. 5, 5, bnt of bribes to
princes in Roman interest, as spoken ol
in c 42, 23 A. 11. 16, 3: cp. ‘pecuniam
et dona, quis solis corrumpantur' (H.
4. 76, 3). It has been thought that
some such action on the part os
Domitian may he here alluded to.

3. populis, dat. os agent, as in c. 31,
1 &a

’urbeaz see Introd. p. 24.

4. colunt, &c It is generally sup-
posed that Tacitus means in this
passage to speak of two modes os
dwelhng, the single houses altogether
separate, and the villages of honses still
cletached but more or less closely
grouped. There is reason to think that
there were at this time two classes of
villages, the dependent lc. 25, r and
note) and the lree (c, 26, 1 and note),
and it is possible that what he speaks os
tirst is in fact the sonner, bnt that the
house of the lord, built where he chose,
is alone mentioned (the hnts os the seris
being sufficiently insignificant to be
ignored), ancl that he then goes on to

speak of the more important or free
villages, which alone he would probably
reckon as ‘vici' It would seem that all
houses belonged in some sense to ‘ vici’
as centres ol justice (c. 12, 3).

diaoreti ao diversi, ‘separated and

in various places': cp. ‘si . .. diversi ·

inrupissent' (H. 3. 46, 3).

5. ut fone, &a SS. notices the
frequency in German names of such
terminations as ‘brunnen’ ‘ feld‚' ‘ berg,’
‘wald’ &c

vicos locant, ‘they lay out their
villages.’ 'l'he description here given
would mark a social stage saraborc
that os Caesar's time, who makes the
Germans (6. 22, 2) have no hxed

dwellings at all (see on c. 26, 2), The ·

account ol Caesar was perhaps even
then true only os some tribes os more
wandering lise. He is thought to have
known most os the Suebi (sce on c. 38,
1), whom he describes separately (4.
1-4).

7. spatio, ‘a homestead,’ gardan,
χορτός, ‘ hortus,' surrounded by a sence.

8. remedium, in apposition with the ’

sentence.

inscitia (causal abl), so with
genit. in Agr. 28,4, &a A sar more
probable reason than either oi these is
to be found in the German love os
independence. From these words he is
led to speak os their mode os building.

caementorum. .. tegularum, This
is confirmed by the absence ol genuine
German names for these and the use of
words of Latin origin, as ⁴ cement' and
‘tile’ (‘Ziegel'). The primitive roos
would be ol straw or rushes, as was that
ol the Ganls (Caes. 5. 43, 1). ‘Cae-
menta,' rough stone (opp. to ‘materia ¹).
