68 CORNELII Τ ACIT I DE GERMANIA

torum quidem apud illos aut tegularum usus: materia ad
omnia utuntur informi et citra speciem aut delectationem.

ut picturam ac liniamenta colorum imitetur. solent et sub-4
,sterraneos specus aperire eosque multo insuper fimo onerant,
suffugium hiemis et receptaculum frugibus quia rigorem fri-
gorum eius modi loci molliunt, et si quando hostis advenit,

4. lineamenta ll C, liniamentabc. caelorum C. imitentur c. 6. hyemi
BC, hiemi b c, text Reifferscheid. 7. locis all, text Acid.

1. materia, ‘timber’3 so in A. ι.
35, 1 (where see note); Caes. 4, 17, 8,
&c ⁴ Zimmer’ (old German ‘Zimbar‘)
means both ‘chamber’ and ‘timben'
Or. and others cite Herodian's account
of German loghouse villages at the time
of Maximin. The beehive sha'ped‚
thatched, windowless huts of the Mar-
comani and Quadi. represented on the
Antonine column (Bartoli, pl. 9, 65,
δια), though evidently conventional,
may correspond somewhat to the rudest
actual type, such as the huts of serfs.

2. informi, uncouthly sashioned.

eitra, ‘falling short of.' The word
is here equivalent to ‘sine’ (cp. ‘citra
Romanum sanguinem bellanti ’ Agr. 35,
a), and has osten a similar force in silver
Latin. See Peterson on Dial. 27, a.

delectationem, ‘comfort’

3. quaedam looa, &o This state·
ment is very obscure, and would appear
as if Tacitus was describing something
which he imperfectly understood. Itis
not clear whether the colouring was on
the exterior or interior surfaces, but it is
most probable that the ‘quaedam loca’
were certain portioris or chambers in-
side, aad that these were plastered over
with coloured earth or earths of such
purity and brightness as to correspond
in some sort to the Roman wall
decorations (such as are seen at Pompeii).
The ‘earth' can hardly be (as some
think) mere white chalk‚ which could
hardly be said ‘imitari picturam,’ but is
probably some kind of ochre, and of
more than one colour, so arranged as to
approach in some sort to a design.
‘Imitari’ has the sense of substitution,
as inVerg. G. 3, 380; Aen. 11, 894,
&c., and ‘picturam' is not ‘a picture'
(in which sense ‘picturas' would
probably have been used) but ‘the art

oi painting,' and iser lained by ‘ lini·
amenta colorum' (a‘liniamenta colo-
rata’). The whole may be translated
tlte,tttthssltlttlttitillat
hue as to form a substitute for paint·
ing and designs in colom? Noae of
the emendations proposed (as ‘poli-
turam' for ‘picturam ‘locorum' ‘cor-
porum‚' &c for ‘ colorum ') appear to
be necessary.

4. solent, probably not with the same
subject as ‘inlinunt‚' bnt rather ‘there
are some who’ &c., like ‘gerunt' (c. 17,
a). The ruder tribes of the north appear
to be meant.

5. specus. Pliny (19. 1, a, 9) speaks
of such not as dwellings but spinning
places (⁴ in Germania defossi atque sub
terra id opus agunt ’), and old laws give
evidence of such workplaces for women
still existing in the middle ages (see Mf.
cited by SS.)‚ as well as storehonses.
Subterranean dwellings for shelter in
winter are described among other
northern nations (cp. Verg. G. 3, 376),
similar to the pit dwellings of which
remains are found in England and else·
where, or to those of the present
Eskimaux.

insuper, either ‘overhead' (c. 12, 1),
or ‘besides' (c. 31. 3; 45,1).

6. hiemis, so most recent edd. (cp.
c.46,4; A. 4. 66, 3). The MS. text
‘hiemi ’ might possibly be taken (with
K.) in the sense ol ‘hominibus hieme
vexatis' It is also possible that the
true text is ‘ hieme.'

7. looi, used notos localities (¹ loca')
but distinct spots, in A. 1. 61, 1, &c.,
also in Sall. and Liv.

advenit, best taken as perf. If it
were present, the subjunct. of frequent
action would be used.
