THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BV TACITUS 17

determining the ethnology of the Venedi and Fenni he has no test 01
language to apply, and is only able to speak 01 111011 tnode of life and
customs ¹.

⁵ Another universal characteristic of the Germans on which he lays
stress, that of their physical appearance ², leads to a difficuliy of which
we should think that he ought himself to have been aware; 101 1110
peculiarities on which he insists, the ruddy hair, fiashing blue eyes,
stalwart limos, and others, agree equally with all Roman description 01 -
1110 Gauls ³, and it would seem that on this point, as well as in several
of their -other qualities ⁴, no clear distinction between the races was
noticed by Greeks or Romans, and that it was long before they
were marked off at all. To Greeks at an earlier date all the north-west
01 Europe was peopled by Κελτοί 01 Γαλάται ⁶: nor does Cicero distin-
guish the nationality of the Teutons and Cimbri from that of those
who had once pillaged Rome under Brennus ⁶. Caesar, the first to
distinguish clearly between Gauls and Germans‚ rests his distinction
not on physique, but on differenees 01 religion and eustoms⁷ ; and
Strabo, writing about nn. 10-20‚ is aware 01 00 stronger physical
difference than that the German is an exaggerated Celt⁸. It should
be remembered that by the time of Tacitus the Gauls had been so

greatly changed and enervated by a century and a half of subjection
as to be no longer liable to be confoundcd in respect of warlike spirit
and qualitiesl, and perhaps less so than formerly even in physical Α
appearance¹⁰, with the fieree and unchanged Germans.
