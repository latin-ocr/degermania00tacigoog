their Castor and Pollux ¹, and another familiar idea in the ‘persuasio ’
oi the sungod’s chariot⁵; there are one or two more deities whom
neither Romans nor moderns have identified ⁶, and here our know-
ledge, so far as it can be based on Tacitus, ends ¹, except lor an
important statement regarding all, namely, that none had temples or
any other places ol worship than the gloom oi hallowed groves, and
that none were ever represented under any visible image, but all only
worshipped as spiritual beings and as discerned by laith⁸, a statement
at variance certainly with all later information, and hard to reconcile
with their strongly anthropomorphic mythology, but so sar in accor-
dance with other parallel evidence¹ as to appear worthy ol belief, when
due allowance is made lor rhetorical colouring.

On the subject ol priests and sacrifices Tacitus is again in advanee
ol Caesar, who was perhaps influenced by the contrast of the Gauls ¹⁰.
The Germans had clearly no such hierarchy as the Druids ; the priest
is but the minister of the gods ¹¹, and only reads the signs, as the
‘pater familiae' also does ¹¹; yet besides his iunctions in worship, the
religious relations ol civil lile give him a position distinct from and
