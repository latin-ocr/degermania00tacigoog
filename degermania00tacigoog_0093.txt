probrum. crebrae, ut inter vinolentos, rixae raro conviciis,
saepius caede et vulneribus transiguntur. sed et de reconci-3
liandis invicem inimicis et iungendis adfinitatibus et adsci-
,escendis principibus de pace denique ac bello plerumque in
conviviis consultant, tamquam nullo magis tempore aut ad
simplices cogitationes pateat animus aut ad⁴ magnas incalescat.

dum fingere nesciunt, constituunt, dum errare non possunt.

3. sed de C c, text Bb.

8. ad hec B, adhec b, ad huc C, ad hoc S, text c.

9. loci B² b’ H M S and Lips.

r. armati: see c. 11, 43 13, 1.

diem noctemque continuare, ‘to
spend the whole day and night'; sc
in A. 16. 5, 2. ln A. rr. 16, 4, a Ger·
man prinee is described as ‘saepius vino·
lentiam ac libidines, grata barbaris, usur·
pans' It would be implied that at
Rome drunkenness, however common,
was not equally uncondemned.

2. ut, se. ‘fierisolet': cp.c.2 4.

3. caede. SS. notes the frequencyos
this as attested by a Salic law holding
the surviving members ol the least re-
sponsible in such cases.

transiguntur, ‘are settled'

4. invicem=‘ inter se'; so ‘miscere
invicem consilia' (Agr. 38, 1), &c Some
would take it adversatively, asin c. 21,
3, &e The custom of sealing the re·
conciliation of a quarrel by drinking

· from the same cup is noted as a survival.

adfinitatibus, ‘family alliances,’
such as those of marriage.

5( principibus, perhaps here ‘duci-
bus' (c. 7, 1): cp. ‘rex . . . adscisce·
retur' (A. 12. ro, 4).

de . . . bello. The rising of Civilis
( H. 4. 14, 3) and that against Varus
(A. 1. 55, 3) were thus projected at
easts, ami a similar ancient Greek cus·
torn is seeu in Hom. Il. 9, 89, foll, &c
llp. Stubbs notes (p. 30) that these
ieasts are a real part of the ‘ concilium’
(c.11‚12),and have their counterpart
iu later times.

6. tamquam, assigning the supposed
reason, as in c. 12, 2, &c

qq. simplices, ἁπλοῦς, ‘unreserved’3

sc ‘simplicissime loquimur’ (H.1. 15,8);
‘convivalium fabularum simplicitas' (A.
6. 5, 2). K. takes it ina sense opposed
to ‘magnas,’ as ‘readily understood,’
such as ‘ reconciliandis inimicis,’ in con-
trast to ‘de bello‚' &o

8. non astuta nec callida, ‘with-
out natural or acquired cunning,’ C. B.

aperit adhue, ‘still continues (cp.
c. 3, 3, &c.) to disclose,' in contrast to
Romans, who had learnt reticence eveu
in their cups (cp. Agr. 2, 3). Some
take ‘adhuc’ with ‘secreta' bnt it ap-
pears to go more commonly with the
preceding word.

9. crgo . . . mens, so stopped by
Halm and Ζ., giving ‘ergo’ its force as
summing up the preceding words. K.
and SS. omit the stop, and take ‘mena’
somewhat boldly, in the sense os ‘con-
silium,' as subject ol ‘retractatur'; to
which, with the other stopping, some
such general subject as ‘res’ must be
supplied from the sense. Some (with
Meiser) read ‘res retractatur) λ

postera dia, &c Herodotus de·
scribes (1. 133, 5) a similar practice
among the ancient Persians.

10. salva . . . ratio ast, ‘the regard
pald to either time (advantage accming
lronr it) is secured ’ : ‘ratio’ seems here
used in a sense akin to the expressions
‘meae’ ‘tuae rationes’ (Cic. and Sall.):
cp. ‘cui . . . ratio fuit' (H. 3. aa, 1).

11. dum=‘tum cum)

constituunt, &c., ‘they decide when
they cannot be misled' (carried away
by excitement). The obvious exaggera-
