Civilis placed two sons of his sisters in
high commands (H. 4. 33, 1; 5. ao, 1).

sanctiorem artioremque, i. e. that

even than the father. This idea seems
clearly to be a survival from the primi-
tive state of society called matriarchal,
in which marriage was frequently poly-
androuS, and relationships and inheri-
tance were reckoned through the mother,
whose eldest brother had the rights of
headship.

4. heredes tamen, i. e. this tie does
not affect inheritance. ln the term ‘ li-
beri’ all direct descendants are included;
bnt Tacitus does not distinguish between
sons and daughters, the latter of whom
took anciently no share, and subse-
quently but a small share of the inheri-
tance. Nor does he state what took
place if a man left daughters only, nor
mention the father as heir to a childless
son. Some custom of primogeniture is
alluded to in e. 32, 4.

accordance with ludian and other early

usage. bnt in strong contrast to Roman
law. ‘It is doubtful whether a true
power of testation was known to any
original society except the Roman’

it was subsequently introduced into
Germany.
