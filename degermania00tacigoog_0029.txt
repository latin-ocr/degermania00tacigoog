¹ ized as deeply recessed and containing islands os vast magnitude¹3
,Ι while the land is spoken olas taking at a certain point a great bend
¹ northward ⁸. In indicating no other natural boundary eastward than
the Carpathians⁴ he is more consistent with his own conception ol
the extent of Germany in that direction than he would have been it
he had followed Mela and Pliny in drawing the line at the Vistula ⁶.
Ι, He is satisfied to distinguish the vast area included within these
' limits into two main portioris, the moist plains of the north aud

Elbe (and that incorrectly τ); os the iorests he notices only the
Hercynian⁸, and both these apparently for special reasons ⁹. His

treatises, and he cannot be assumed to be ignorant ol all that he bas

: His mapping out of the country among the several tribes is l

' been far clearer if rivers and other natural features had been taken
more account of. Sometimes definiteness is given by the mention
of the Rhine or Danube, the ocean, or a mountain tract ¹¹, very often
the position oi this or that people is given only relatively to that
of otherS, as ‘a fronte,’ ‘a tergo,' ‘a latere ¹²,' and is more and more
vaguely indicated, as is but natural, the more he recedes from the
frontier. We have, however, certainly no earlier extant account in
