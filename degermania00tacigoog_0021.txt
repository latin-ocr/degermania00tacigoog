him to abandon his original intention, convert the excursus into
a substantive work, and enlarge it to its present dimensions.

Nor are we wholly without grounds of conjecture as to his possible
reasons for working it up to completion and publishing it at this parti·
cular time. The whole subject had acquired a recent interest from
the wars os Domitian, and the elevation of Trajan to the principate
found him occupied with the charge oi the Roman ‘Germaniae’¹;
and instead os hastening at once to Rome, where we are' told that his
presence was eagerly desired‚ he remained on the Rhine and Danube
frontier more than a year longer, carrying out, with his characteristic
thoroughness, the defensive policy which had succeeded to the carn-
paigns of Domitian, and which had evidently commended itself to his
own jungement2. Terms were made with nations on the spot, the
frontier all along was carefully laid out and strengthened by colonies
and military posts³3 the ‘limes' beyond the Rhine, commenced by
previous emperors and carried on by Domitian, was further extended
and now included definitely within the empire the ‘agri decumates‚'
and gave the Romanized settlers a saie looting on that once debatable
land⁴. At Rome this policy would be regarded with mixed feelings,
and the more ardent spirits would be disappointed, as it betokened
that the new ruler‚ great soldier as he was, had not only no intention
of advancing the eagles again to the frontier of the Elbe, but even
considered that the existing position was perilous, and that circum-
stances might make the German race lonnidable even lor aggression.
At such a time Tacitus coines lorward to support this prudent policy
with all the force of his eloquence and weight of his position, and to
combine with the literary purpose which may have originally led to
the collection and arrangement of his store of material the present
